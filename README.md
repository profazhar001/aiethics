# Make-A-Thon

### BMCC - Fall 2020 Virtual Make-A-Thon for Social Good Challenge.
The Call for Code Global Challenge — created by David Clark Cause and supported by Founding Partner IBM and Charitable Partner United Nations Human Rights — invites developers and problem solvers around the world to build solutions that fight back against the most pressing issues of our time.

## Cybersecurity Education For Elderly People
is a project that focuses on informing senior citizens of cybersecurity risks and the proper security tools to monitor their IoT devices. 
Since the start of COVID-19, cybercrime has increased 400%. Ideally, tools like a chatbot, quiz, an application, and references to important sources of information
on the website we've created will help elderly people to become familiar with terms and concepts of cybersecurity risks. We intend to provide advisories 
on how they can protect themselves from cybercrimes.
